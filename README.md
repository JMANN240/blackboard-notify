# Blackboard Notify

## A Firefox extension so you only have to *kind of* be present.

This is a Firefox extension that alerts you when a new person joins a Blackboard Collaborate Ultra session by sending an HTTP request to the url of your choice. This can be used to flash internet controlled lights or other smart home operations. Check the box in the settings to start listening for new people and specify the url to request.
